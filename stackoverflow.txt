Hello, I try not to ask for help and figure it out on my own but this is extremely tough and I cannot figure out how to fix it. I am using Python 2.7 and Django 1.4. I am using Tomcat 7.0 and Solr as my backend for Haystack v2 beta. I have Pysolr v 3 installed. The Apache Tomcat service is running just fine, I can go to 127.0.0.1:8000/solr/admin. I ran manage.py build_solr_schema and took that schema.xml file and placed it in my C:\solr\conf folder. 

As the last step, I am suppose to run manage.py rebuild_index. When I type that into the command prompt and click enter, I get the usual message:

    WARNING: This will irreparably remove EVERYTHING from your search index in connection 'default'.
    Your choices after this are to restore from backups or rebuild via the `rebuild_index` command.
    Are you sure you wish to continue? [y/N]

Then when I enter 'y' and click enter again, I get the following:

    Removing all documents from your index because you said so
    All documents removed.
    Indexing 71 readings.

Please help as I have been slaving over this for some time. I have gotten this setup to work on my home computer, but my computer at work is just not playing nice. Thank you so very much in advance.
